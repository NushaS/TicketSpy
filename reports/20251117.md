## Project meeting agenda

- Miscellaneous Q&A time (upcoming deadlines, sticking points, procedural questions, etc.)

## Team Goals

### 1. Last week's goals

#### Challenges/things that we had trouble with include:

- Implement enforcement sighting notifications to stay on the map for exactly 1 hour after being reported (2 days)

### 2. Progress and issues

#### Nusha:
- I worked on and finished creating and implementing the filtering system for the ticket report
- I created the report parking enforcement button
- I have been working with Ahana on the parking enforcement reporting
- I learned about the logistics of connecting the API for the parking enforcement reporting, but we have been having issues getting the backend and frontend to connect
- I had some merge conflicts with the parking enforcement API but I was able to fix it

#### Abigail:
- Worked with Timofei to add delete functionality for parking/bookmarking
- Created user instructions and then added it to the UI for the instructions modal
- Had discussions about notification implementation with Timfoei, but currently stuck with Twilio notifications because we need approval, may use SendGrid instead
- Chose not to change UI to be for phone numbers as we may need to stay with email notifs
- Made some more small UI fixes
- Was under the weather this week, so progress was less than expected

#### Timofei:
- Sending users text messages requires approval as a verified business (applied and got rejected, will try again). Instead investigated email notifications with SendGrid
- Setup logic for notifications for nearby parking enforcement sighting and ticketing
- Added deleting functionality for parking and bookmarking

#### Ahana:
- Finished pushing changes from my branch to dev
- Debugged merge conflict issues with frontend
- Got frontend and backend code on same branch successfully

**Challenges:**
- Due to conflicts delayed connecting frontend to backend

#### Aya:
- Implemented some small UI details (increasing font weight in certain places to improve readability, adding icons to popup button, adjusting spacing)
- Created the profile icon component and incorporated it into the header for logged in users (in place of login/create account buttons)
- Tiny progress made with regards to bookmark/parking click logic (clicking pins on the map to remove/change them)

**Challenges:**
- Figuring out how to get the display name from the db and render it below the profile icon took some time.
- Progress is slow with bookmark/parking click logic (due to time constraints, more than the nature of the work)

#### Leo:
- Supabase setting cascading deletes for all tables to more cleanly get rid of a user
- Tried to set up a well-researched ticket_violation_type with multiple tickets. But work was obsolete as I forgot it’s focus was only parking tickets, need to show more clearly “TicketSpy” name means parking Tickets only. Good learning experience.
- Worked minimally w/ Tim to look at Twilio license validation. Also worked with Nusha to Vercel upload our Github.
- Issue: API key’s template started with NEXT_PUBLIC, need to reset API keys and get rid of that as it may be leaking important data
- Added “display_name” to signup page w/ supabase integration
