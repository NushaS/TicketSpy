#### Progress and issues  
This week we had more parallel efforts and sub-team meetings than previous weeks, which enabled us to achieve:
- Had to figure out a tile provider for MapLibre which fetches map chunks which MapLibre puts together. Settled on OpenFreeMap because most others are paid services. 
- Designed database schema 
- Implemented Supabase w/ the schema & implemented TanStack query to work alongside it 
- Aligned team agile schedule with course expectations 
- Began frontend tool setup
- Designed app structure and functionality behavior, and built a clickable prototype in figma to represent it

Challenges/things that we had trouble with include:
- Next.js pre-built Supabase structure has some important stuff the entire team should know about (such as auto-routing)
- Reasoning about frontend structure was difficult without visual basis, but the completion of the figma design will alleviate this problem in the upcoming week.

These tasks are rolled over from last week:
- Fetch and display mock data from database on map (as pins and/or heatmap)

We are not stuck anywhere this week!

### Plans and goals for the next week
- Complete testing and CI milestone(team effort)
    - Time estimate: 2 days (due Tuesday Oct 28)
- Next.js + Tailwind project (Nusha & Aya)
    - Time estimate: 2 days
- Set up Database RLS policies (Leo)
    - Time estimate: 2 day	
- Incorporate UI components into the project frontend (Aya)
    - Time estimate: 2-3 days
- Ensuring frontend and backend compatibility (PM + frontend + backend)
    - Time estimate: 1 day
- Continuing MapLibre work - Supabase integration and getting the heatmap to work (Abigail & Timofei)
    - Time estimate: 2 days

    - [x] Get maplibre map to display (2 days)
    - [ ] Fetch and display mock data from database on map (as pins and/or heatmap) (3 days)
    - [x] Meet with Abigail to collaborate on mapLibre (1 day)

4. Ahana:

    - [x] Set up TanStack Query (1 day)
    - [ ] Longer term goal: coordinate with Figma designers to see what features we would need to implement from the backend side

5. Aya:
    - [x] Coordinate design ideas with Abigail (meet once during the week) to develop app layout and feature designs on figma (3 days total)

6. Leo:
    - [x] Set up DB schema (1 day)
    - [ ] Set up tanstack query (1 day)

### Progress and issues 
1. Nusha:
    - Did a breakdown of what needs to be done for each week leading up to our presentation day
    - Further split tasks up between the different roles and team members. Updated the Agile schedule accordingly for the next two weeks
    - Did not schedule meeting with backend to discuss frontend framework compatibility yet, but will have no trouble arranging that for this week
    - Had trouble making concrete decisions for the frontend layout but now the Figma is ready so I will be unstuck going forward now that I have a reference to start working on

2. Abigail:
    - Worked with team to complete milestone 3, determining specifics of our software architecture
    - Downloaded necessary packages for TanStack Query
    - Had 2 UI design meetings with Aya
        - #1 - Discussed user types, feature UI options, app structure and number of pages, map pin logic. After this meeting, we both drew design maps on paper based on the discussion.
        - #2 - Compared our design maps to clarify differences and confirm shared understanding visually. On figma, built some shared UI components (buttons, icons) and had a synchronous working session where we each worked on different app pages/features'
    - Also worked individually on creating pages, components and connecting components of prototype on figma
    - Completed working clickable prototype with Aya
    - Met with Tim to discuss his work with MapLibre and align with our ideas
    - I’m not stuck anywhere this week, but I did struggle a bit with the learning curve on Figma. I also found that making the prototype was very time-consuming and took a lot of effort. Other than that, no challenges.

3. Timofei:
    - Downloaded necessary packages for TanStack Query
    - Setup OpenFreeMap for tile serving and MapLibre for map rendering
      - This was an issue discovered while trying to use setup maplibre. We also needed to get tile provider for maplibre to use to know what to display
    - Met with Abigail to discuss MapLibre and align with our ideas
    - Able to display pins of mock data on map (not heatmap yet)

4. Ahana:
    - Created schema and tables in Supabase
    - Started setting up TanStack (React Query)

5. Aya:
    - Through combined efforts with Abigail, arrived at a functional clickable prototype
      - Drafted a design doc with a set of UI and functionality questions based on the architecture and proposal documents; this served as a starting point for design meeting 1 with Abigail.
      - Had 2 design meetings with Abigail
          - #1 - Discussed user types, feature UI options, app structure and number of pages, map pin logic. After this meeting, we both drew design maps on paper based on the discussion.
          - #2 - Compared our design maps to clarify differences and confirm shared understanding visually. On figma, built some shared UI components (buttons, icons) and had a synchronous working session where we each worked on different app pages/features.
      - Individually, worked on specific pages and functionalities within the mockup (such as the profile settings page and the bookmark/parking feature).
    - I am not stuck anywhere this week, and was able to meet my goal; the things that I found most challenging this week were determining how to structure the app pages, and getting comfortable with working in figma.

6. Leo:
    - Worked w/ Ahana & meeting on Sunday
    - Set up Supabase tables (users, tickets, enforcement_sightings)  w/ foreign key relationships
    - Set up working Tanstack query on `localhost:8000/test-query`
    - No real “issues”
