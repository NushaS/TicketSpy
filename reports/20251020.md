## Instructions: 

Each status report must be a markdown file and must include the following two sections:

Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

Contributions of individual team members.

Both sections should have the following three subsections. Each subsection is best organized as bullet points.

Last week’s goals: an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It is empty for the first week.

Progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

Plans and goals for the next week: each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate.

You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task.

If tasks from one week ago aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with a brief statement about struggles or blockers, and an updated estimate for time to completion.

For individual team members, no bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days. If a task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to have insight into progress.

For the team report, this subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.
