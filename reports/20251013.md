# Instructions: 

Each status report must include the following two sections:

1. Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

2. Contributions of individual team members.
   

Both sections should have the following three subsections (each subsection is best organized as bullet points):

1. Last week’s goals: an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It is empty for the first week.

2. Progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

3. Plans and goals for the next week: each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate.
    - You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task.
    - If tasks from one week ago aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with a brief statement about struggles or blockers, and an updated estimate for time to completion.
    - For individual team members, no bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days. If a task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to have insight into progress.
    - For the team report, this subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.

## Team Report 
#### Project meeting agenda
1. Sharing progress & issues and plans & goals sections from status report
2. Request status report feedback for improving during the upcoming week
3. Review feedback from project architecture submission
4. Miscellanous Q & A time (upcoming deadlines, sticking points, procedural questions, etc.)
   
#### Last week's goals 
  - Outlining general system and tools (choosing what platforms to work with)
  - Set up Supabase & ensure that all teammates have access to it
  - Begin establishing database schema
  - Have everyone install Node & npm
  - Set up Next.js project connected with Supabase and Tanstack query
    
#### Progress and issues  
This week we all learned how to set up a Next.js project and get our development servers running locally. In particular, the things we did are:
  - Received feedback on our initial proposal; worked out necessary adjustments to be made based on the feedback.
  - Set up Supabase project and Next.js app
  - Each team member adds .env.local Supabase credentials file to their local setup
    
Challenges/things that we had trouble with include:
  - Unknown course milestones for the upcoming weeks; weren’t able to adapt our schedule for the whole quarter concretely, and had some trouble locating deadlines and instructions.
  - Some of the feedback that we received on our proposal required us to re-evaluate our entire product more than anticipated.

These tasks are rolled over from last week; because of the time spent re-evaluating our proposal and getting everyone's Supabase credentials set up (in addition to the database itself), we simply did not reach these task in time:
  - Still need to set up Database schema
  - Still need to set up Tanstack query

We are not stuck anywhere this week, but as described above, did not complete all of our goals in time.

#### Plans and goals for the next week
  - Complete architecture and design document (team effort)
      - Time estimate: 2 days
  - Install tanstack query dependencies (Ahana & Leo)
      - Time estimate:
  - Define database schema (Ahana & Leo)
      - Time estimate:
  - Create Figma design for the app layout (Aya & Abigail)
      - Time estimate: 3 days
      - This is the initial step in creating mockups for all features in the app.
  - Subdivide existing tasks + add new tasks in the schedule document (Nusha)
      - Time estimate:
  - Get maplibre embedded in webpage and display pins based on mock data from database (Timofei & Abigail)
      - Time estimate: 
      - This is the initial step in the long-term goal of implementing the heatmap.
  - Figure out deployment to vercel (team effort)
      - Time estimate: 2 days
    
## Contributions of individual team members

   - Experiment with maplibre.
   - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
4. Ahana:
   - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
5. Aya:
    - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
6. Leo:
    - Set up the Supabase database and set up schema.

#### Progress and issues  
1. Nusha:
   - New changes made to course schedule impacted Agile deadlines.
   - Set up environment and got development server running, and made sure local repository is up to date (had a few syncing issues).
   - Updated previously set deadlines.
2. Abigail:
   - Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
   - The feedback on the proposal set back timeline on design plans a bit.
3. Timofei:
   - Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
   - Checked maplibre API.
4. Ahana:
   - Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
   - Began brainstorming schema ideas.
5. Aya:
   - Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
   - Added reports/ directory to the repo
   - Created a shared figma project, but the feedback on the proposal set back timeline on design plans a bit.
6. Leo:
   - Set up Supabase database and sent out invites to teammates.
   - Set up Next.js w/ Supabase template (ran into some version-related issues during this process).
   - Added Next.js project setup instructions to README.
   - Shared Supabase environment variables with the team
