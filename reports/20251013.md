# Team Report

### Project meeting agenda

1. Sharing progress & issues and plans & goals sections from status report
2. Request status report feedback for improving during the upcoming week
3. Review feedback from project architecture submission
4. Miscellanous Q & A time (upcoming deadlines, sticking points, procedural questions, etc.)

### Last week's goals

- Outlining general system and tools (choosing what platforms to work with)
- Set up Supabase & ensure that all teammates have access to it
- Begin establishing database schema
- Have everyone install Node & npm
- Set up Next.js project connected with Supabase and Tanstack query

#### Progress and issues

This week we all learned how to set up a Next.js project and get our development servers running locally. In particular, the things we did are:

- Received feedback on our initial proposal; worked out necessary adjustments to be made based on the feedback.
- Set up Supabase project and Next.js app
- Each team member adds .env.local Supabase credentials file to their local setup

Challenges/things that we had trouble with include:

- Unknown course milestones for the upcoming weeks; weren’t able to adapt our schedule for the whole quarter concretely, and had some trouble locating deadlines and instructions.
- Some of the feedback that we received on our proposal required us to re-evaluate our entire product more than anticipated.

These tasks are rolled over from last week; because of the time spent re-evaluating our proposal and getting everyone's Supabase credentials set up (in addition to the database itself), we simply did not reach these tasks in time:

- Still need to set up Database schema
- Still need to set up Tanstack query

We are not stuck anywhere this week, but as described above, did not complete all of our goals in time.

### Plans and goals for the next week

- Complete architecture and design document (team effort)
  - Time estimate: 2 days
- Install tanstack query dependencies (Ahana & Leo)
  - Time estimate: 1 day
- Define database schema (Ahana & Leo)
  - Time estimate: 1 day
- Create Figma design for the app layout (Aya & Abigail)
  - Time estimate: 3 days
  - This is the initial step in creating mockups for all features in the app.
- Subdivide existing tasks + add new tasks in the schedule document (Nusha)
  - Time estimate:
- Implement MapLibre API and display pins based on mock data from database (Timofei & Abigail)
  - Time estimate: 3 days
  - This is the initial step in the long-term goal of implementing the heatmap.
- Figure out deployment to Vercel (team effort)
  - Time estimate: 2 days

# Contributions of individual team members

### Last week's goals

1. Nusha:

- Establish Agile schedule and milestones.
- Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.

2. Abigail:
   - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
3. Timofei:
   - Experiment with maplibre.
   - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
4. Ahana:
   - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
5. Aya:
   - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
6. Leo:
   - Set up the Supabase database and set up schema.

### Progress and issues

1. Nusha:

- New changes made to course schedule impacted Agile deadlines.
- Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
- Learned how to connect repository to Supabase credentials
- Had a few syncing issues with the repository, but it was fixed by doing a reset
- Updated previously set deadlines.

2. Abigail:

- Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
- The feedback on the proposal set back timeline on design plans a bit.
- Had challenges with Node installation, but was able to figure it out fairly quickly

3. Timofei:

- Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
- Checked maplibre API.

4. Ahana:

- Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
- Began brainstorming schema ideas, had to be preliminary since we weren’t quite sure what the final product would need.

5. Aya:

- Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file); tried setting up Next.js for the team initially, but realized later that it would be more beneficial to integrate Supabase early on, and passed this work on to Leo.
- Added reports/ directory to the repo
- Created a shared figma project, but the feedback on the proposal set back timeline on design plans a bit.

6. Leo:

- Set up Supabase database and sent out invites to teammates.
- Set up Next.js w/ Supabase template (ran into some version-related issues during this process).
- Added Next.js project setup instructions to README.
- Shared Supabase environment variables with the team
- Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).

### Plans and goals for the next week

1. Nusha:

- Finish creating Agile deadlines to reflect course expectations. (1 day)
- May incur issues with course schedule not being finalized
- Start frontend tool setup and select a JavaScript framework. (3 days max)
- Will need to ensure compatibility of framework with backend
- Longer-term goal: Start working with UI designers to figure out what’s possible with the front-end (start next week)

2. Abigail:

- Coordinate design ideas with Aya (meet once during the week) to develop app layout and feature designs on figma (3 days total).
- Might struggle with issues with figuring out figma as it is a new technology for me
- Set up TanStack Query (1 day)
- Work with Timofei on adding in maplibre API (two days), meet towards end of week
- Longer term goal: talking to others about what features we can add that set our product apart

3. Timofei:

- Set up TanStack Query (1 day)
- Get maplibre map to display (2 days)
- Fetch and display mock data from database on map (as pins and/or heatmap) (3 days)
- Meet with Abigail to collaborate on mapLibre (1 day)

4. Ahana:

- Set up DB schema (1 day)
- Set up TanStack Query (1 day)
- Longer term goal: coordinate with Figma designers to see what features we would need to implement from the backend side

5. Aya:

- Coordinate design ideas with Abigail (meet once during the week) to develop app layout and feature designs on figma (3 days total)
- This is my first experience with figma so I am expecting the initial steps to take extra time

6. Leo:

- Set up DB schema (1 day)
- Set up tanstack query (1 day)
