# Team Report 
### Project meeting agenda
1. Sharing progress & issues and plans & goals sections from status report
2. Request status report feedback for improving during the upcoming week
3. Review feedback from project architecture submission
4. Miscellanous Q & A time (upcoming deadlines, sticking points, procedural questions, etc.)
   
### Last week's goals 
  - Outlining general system and tools (choosing what platforms to work with)
  - Set up Supabase & ensure that all teammates have access to it
  - Begin establishing database schema
  - Have everyone install Node & npm
  - Set up Next.js project connected with Supabase and Tanstack query
    
#### Progress and issues  
This week we all learned how to set up a Next.js project and get our development servers running locally. In particular, the things we did are:
  - Received feedback on our initial proposal; worked out necessary adjustments to be made based on the feedback.
  - Set up Supabase project and Next.js app
  - Each team member adds .env.local Supabase credentials file to their local setup
    
Challenges/things that we had trouble with include:
  - Unknown course milestones for the upcoming weeks; weren’t able to adapt our schedule for the whole quarter concretely, and had some trouble locating deadlines and instructions.
  - Some of the feedback that we received on our proposal required us to re-evaluate our entire product more than anticipated.

These tasks are rolled over from last week; because of the time spent re-evaluating our proposal and getting everyone's Supabase credentials set up (in addition to the database itself), we simply did not reach these tasks in time:
  - Still need to set up Database schema
  - Still need to set up Tanstack query

We are not stuck anywhere this week, but as described above, did not complete all of our goals in time.

### Plans and goals for the next week
  - Complete architecture and design document (team effort)
      - Time estimate: 2 days
  - Install tanstack query dependencies (Ahana & Leo)
    - Time estimate: 1 day
  - Define database schema (Ahana & Leo)
    - Time estimate: 1 day
  - Create Figma design for the app layout (Aya & Abigail)
    - Time estimate: 3 days
    - This is the initial step in creating mockups for all features in the app.
  - Subdivide existing tasks + add new tasks in the schedule document (Nusha)
    - Time estimate: 
  - Implement MapLibre API and display pins based on mock data from database (Timofei & Abigail)
    - Time estimate: 3 days
    - This is the initial step in the long-term goal of implementing the heatmap.
  - Figure out deployment to Vercel (team effort)
    - Time estimate: 2 days

    
# Contributions of individual team members
### Last week's goals 
1. Nusha:
  - Establish Agile schedule and milestones.
  - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
2. Abigail:
   - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
3. Timofei:
   - Experiment with maplibre.
   - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
4. Ahana:
   - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
5. Aya:
    - Set up the general system flow and tools: set up Supabase credentials and connect with Next.js project.
6. Leo:
    - Set up the Supabase database and set up schema.

### Progress and issues  
1. Nusha:
  - New changes made to course schedule impacted Agile deadlines.
  - Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
  - Learned how to connect repository to Supabase credentials
  - Had a few syncing issues with the repository, but it was fixed by doing a reset
  - Updated previously set deadlines.
2. Abigail:
  - Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
  - The feedback on the proposal set back timeline on design plans a bit.
  - Had challenges with Node installation, but was able to figure it out fairly quickly
3. Timofei:
  - Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
  - Checked maplibre API.
4. Ahana:
  - Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).
  - Began brainstorming schema ideas, had to be preliminary since we weren’t quite sure what the final product would need.
5. Aya:
  - Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file); tried setting up Next.js for the team initially, but realized later that it would be more beneficial to integrate Supabase early on, and passed this work on to Leo. 
  - Added reports/ directory to the repo
  - Created a shared figma project, but the feedback on the proposal set back timeline on design plans a bit.
6. Leo:
  - Set up Supabase database and sent out invites to teammates.
  - Set up Next.js w/ Supabase template (ran into some version-related issues during this process).
  - Added Next.js project setup instructions to README.
  - Shared Supabase environment variables with the team
  - Set up environment and got development server running (cloned repo, downloaded software, added Supabase environment variables file).

### Plans and goals for the next week
1. Nusha:
  - Finish creating Agile deadlines to reflect course expectations. (1 day)
  - May incur issues with course schedule not being finalized
  - Start frontend tool setup and select a JavaScript framework. (3 days max)
  - Will need to ensure compatibility of framework with backend
  - Longer-term goal: Start working with UI designers to figure out what’s possible with the front-end (start next week)
2. Abigail:
  - Coordinate design ideas with Aya (meet once during the week) to develop app layout and feature designs on figma (3 days total). 
  - Might struggle with issues with figuring out figma as it is a new technology for me
  - Set up TanStack Query (1 day)
  - Work with Timofei on adding in maplibre API (two days), meet towards end of week
  - Longer term goal: talking to others about what features we can add that set our product apart
3. Timofei:
  - Set up TanStack Query (1 day)
  - Get maplibre map to display (2 days)
  - Fetch and display mock data from database on map (as pins and/or heatmap) (3 days)
  - Meet with Abigail to collaborate on mapLibre (1 day)
4. Ahana:
  - Set up DB schema (1 day)
  - Set up TanStack Query (1 day)
  - Longer term goal: coordinate with Figma designers to see what features we would need to implement from the backend side
5. Aya:
  - Coordinate design ideas with Abigail (meet once during the week) to develop app layout and feature designs on figma (3 days total)
  - This is my first experience with figma so I am expecting the initial steps to take extra time
6. Leo:
  - Set up DB schema (1 day)
  - Set up tanstack query (1 day)
