### 2. Progress and issues

#### Nusha:
- Experimented with parking enforcement reporting popup sizing to make it match the rest of the site  
- Did research on information about how to address parking tickets and narrowed down credible sources to include in the Thank You for Reporting popup message  
- Worked on shrinking the header bar at the top of the page  
- Make opacity slider go away  
  - Having trouble with it only remaining when using filters and no other popup

#### Abigail: 
- Made a lot of small UI changes  
- Created api route for updating notification settings  
- Implemented displaying notification settings and connected UI to backend, so notifications successfully toggle now  
- Rerouted log in/create account buttons on pop up to go to correct pages  
- Looked into rate limiting  
- No challenges and not stuck currently

#### Timofei:

#### Ahana:
- Set email notifications for users only when tickets have been reported in the past 24 hours  
- Started looking through frontend for any visual issues with reporting tickets 

#### Aya:
- Finished profile account details section of the profile settings page  
  - Added editable name/email fields to the section  
  - Implemented log out and delete account functionality  
- Currently working on the bookmark/parking session modification logic  
  - Updating the pin logic to match the figma prototype (parking at bookmarked spots, “ending” parking sessions, bookmarking parking spots when ending parking sessions)  
  - Integrating the existing delete pin code into the updated logic  
  - Applying styling to the three relevant modals  
- Challenges:  
  - Had to debug/improve several details in the account details work after its initial release (refactoring the code to use an existing hook, renaming files to improve clarity, fixing user table email field update issue)  
  - Battled some syncing issues with my IDE  
  - Not getting sidetracked by small bugs and inconsistencies (had to think about which fixes were and were not directly related to the task at hand)
