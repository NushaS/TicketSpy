## 2. Progress and issues
what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck
Each team 
- We met as a whole team to go over the Figma design and discuss the components. This included confirming the flow of the app, giving feedback on designs, and filtering options. We were able to agree on the final design and features that we want to work towards.
### Challenges/things that we had trouble with include:
- We had a lengthy discussion on what information is necessary to be displayed on the map, and what options should be included as the filters. It was difficult to ensure that we encompassed all our user’s needs and expectations.
- Some components, such as filtering by time of day of ticketing, will be more difficult to implement than previously expected.
- Long discussion on github repo, unsure whether “dev” branch was required for project but was productive to learn about. Will ask TA for guidance.


## 3. Plans and goals for the next week
measurable + time estimate
- Continue developing our current naive version of the app interface to more closely represent our design goal. Focus mainly on the home page/login options for this week (Front-end team)
  - Time estimate: 4 days
- Long term goal: Have heatmap coloring that has full coverage of the map and is accurate to ticket reports (front-end + backend)
  - Time estimate: Develop next week
- Prepare for class Demo of TicketSpy: finalize functionality/prepare to present if necessary (everyone)
  - Time estimate: 2 days

## 2. Progress and issues - what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck
1. Nusha:
- Attended the group meeting to go over UI design, confirmed that it fits the original vision for the webapp. Gave feedback on filtering methods and ticket report data collection.
- Met with Aya and Abigail as the UI designers and front-end team to go over how to convert Figma to code. We found multiple different methods of converting the Figma layout to code, and Aya and I decided on a few to divide up and try out.
- I learned that there are a lot of new tools out there that use AI to provide the base code based on Figma, which was very interesting. However, we had trouble discerning at first glance which one would serve us best.
- Looked at Timofei’s current mockup for the website and thought about how I can contribute to further developing it.
- No current blockers, but I need to start finalizing code to be able to create a pull request with something substantial to contribute.


2.   Abigail: 
- I worked with Timofei on MapLibre and got the heatmap display working with fake data (just in source code), still working with him and Leo and Ahana to get Supabase integrated. I did research on TanStack Query and learned how it calls the api routes and how the backend calls Supabase.
- I made the google form to get data from people in the community about their parking tickets, sent it to the team and got starter data.


- Met with Leo, Ahana and Timofei to figure out how integration of TanStack Query + Supabase for the map data will work


- Added more details to the figma, like logic for reporting parking enforcement officers.


- Adjusted UI on the website to be more aesthetically pleasing


- Worked with Leo to modify database schema.


- Issues: It was a bit hard to understand how TanStack Query interacts with back end and front end. We also had some merge conflicts and issues with VSCode, but I was able to resolve them in about an hour.


- Not currently stuck, but a bit concerned with progress because we still haven’t pulled mock data from the database yet.




3. Timofei:
- Got a heatmap working with mock data (hard coded as array). Worked with Abigail on website layout and further implementing the figma. Added a login and information page. Met with Leo to discuss TanStack and database progress.
- Issues - Figuring out how to make requests to the database using TanStack query and display real user data. Still in progress.
4. Ahana:
- Set Database RLS policies to be read only. Met with Abigail, Leo, and Timofei to figure out the integration of TanStack Query and Supabase for the map data. Changed table schema based on discussions and created new tables in the database to update changes. I need to continue studying TanStack Query and how we can implement it in the backend. 
5. Aya:
- Facilitated a whole-team design brief together with Abigail, during which we presented the clickable prototype, addressed questions, and aligned on further adjustments/additions to the app design.
- Created documentation plans for development guide, user guide, and admin guide
- Looked into existing tools for incorporating figma components into the project frontend, and found a few candidates (figma dev mode, figma make, build.io).
- Issues: time was quite limited for me this week, so I did not make it as far as I had hoped into actually working with the figma-to-frontend tools, so this will be my first task in the upcoming week. 
6. Leo:
- Database RLS policies are just set as “Read-only” for now. Sufficient
- Met w/ Tim & Abigail & Ahana to connect the Supabase w/ Tanstack to the front-end. It worked well. Managed to showcase the Supabase data onto the home-page/map-page
  - Issue: Still need to validate data, but tickets are showing up!
- Fixed issue with Provider that disappeared, easy fix but surprising
